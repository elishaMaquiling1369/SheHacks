## Inspiration
As someone who gets easily distracted, especially during online school, 
I needed an application that would force me to stay focused on schoolwork without getting too overwhelmed. I also wanted to create something that would help others stay productive, especially during times like these when everyone can only stay home.

## What is Timely
It is an app that integrates the Pomodoro technique. There are two timers: the work and break intervals. The user can choose how long they would want to do work for, as well as how long they would want their breaks to be. The work timer counts down, and notifies the user when it is time for their break.
